# 2022-SEMB-Q3Q4: AIES Challenge: Integrated Building Information Models and Robotics



## Description

Detailed 3D Building Information Models are available in Revit. Standard practice in the building industry makes such BIM models available. While Revit is a proprietary (closed) commercial BIM tool, a neutral data model and file format is available as well, namely the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). Such information needs to be made available to robots to ease their localisation and navigation. That is your challenge. This is tested in a barn environment, where agricultural robots need to be able to navigate in their environment and perform actions with cattle present inside the barn.

The challenge includes a number of steps.

# Project assignment
## Knowledge graph generator for BIM models

## High quality digital twin that includes good 2D and 3D geometry


## Creation of robot-specific navigation and localization maps


## Enable navigation and task execution (validation)


## Update the BIM model based on metrics obtained by robot
